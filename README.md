# vimrc

Only `vimrc` needed to get anything done. Only has [auto-pairs](https://github.com/jiangmiao/auto-pairs) and
[tokyonight-vim](https://github.com/ghifarit53/tokyonight-vim) (for color thememing) loaded as static plugins.


No need for autocompletion, syntax check, or any bloated feature. Just learn how to program.
